# USER CAN SIGN UP

## CLIENT

- When the user inputs a username and password, the state is updated to the user
- input. After the request is sent to the server, the client receives a
- response. If the action is to sign up, the user is redirected to a sign-in
- page.

## SERVER

- When the user presses enter or clicks the submit button, a fetch request is
-sent to the server with the state assigned to the body. This will send a post
- method to the server creating a new account. If the username is unique, and
- does not already exist, we will inject the username and hashed password to the
- database. Otherwise we will catch the error and use our error middleware.

## DATABASE

- Our database holds a userId, createdAt, unique username, and hashedPassword.
- If the username submitted is unique, the username and hashedPassword will
- be injected into the server. The account now exists in the database.


# USER CAN SIGN IN

## CLIENT

- By default, we will display the sign-in page. The user will input a username
- and password which will update the state in AuthForm. When the user presses
- enter or clicks submit, we will send a fetch request with the state value
- assigned to the body to the server.

## SERVER

- If the username does not exist or the hashedPassword does not match, we will
- throw an error to the user. If the username and hashedPassword is verified by
- matching the username and hashedPassword. We will create a payload object of
- the userId and username. We then take the payload object and create a token.

## DATABASE

- The hashedPassword and username are sent to the database and we check to see
- if they are matching. If they match, the account is authorized and we create a
- token.
