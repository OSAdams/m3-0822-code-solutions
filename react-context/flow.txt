# USER CAN SIGN UP

## CLIENT

- When the user inputs a username and password,
- the state is updated to the user input. After the request
- is sent to the server, the client receives a response. If
- the action is to sign up, the user is redirected to a sign-in
- page.

## SERVER

- When the user presses enter or clicks the submit button,
- a fetch request is sent to the server with the state
- assigned to the body. This will send a post method to the server
- creating a new account. If the username is unique, and does not already exist,
- we will inject the username and hashed password to the database. Otherwise we will
- catch the error and use our error middleware

## DATABASE

- Our database holds a userId, createdAt, unique username, and hashedPassword.
- If the username submitted is unique, the username and hashedPassword will be injected
- into the server. The account now exists in the database.


# USER CAN SIGN IN

## CLIENT

- By default, we will display the sign-in page. The user will input a username
- and password which will update the state in AuthForm. When the user presses
- enter or clicks submit, we will send a fetch request with the state value assigned
- to the body to the server.

## SERVER

- If the username and password do not exist, we will throw an error to the user.
- Otherwise
